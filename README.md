* recover /rɪˈkʌv.ɚ/

We all spend a lot of our time snoozing. In fact, children sleep for almost half of their lives. Why? It's because our bodies need it. Sleep is just as important as food and exercise.

Have you ever wondered why we sleep at night-time, instead of during the day? You can't see it, but your body has a clock which matches the Sun, and it can tell when it's night and when it's day. As night comes, and it gets darker, your brain tells you it's time for sleep. But we're not all exactly the same when it comes to bedtime...

Some of us like to go to sleep early, and to wake up early as well. These people are sometimes called larks because larks wake up and start singing as soon as it is light.

Others like to go to bed later, and then sleep late in the morning. They are often called night owls because owls are nocturnal, meaning they're active at night.

* Larks wake early to sing their songs.
* Owls come out at night.

Which one are you?

So what exactly is sleep? It's a natural state of rest, where your awareness of what's happening around you gets turned right down. There are several different stages of sleep, which repeat through the night.

* It takes around seven minutes for most of us to go from wakefulness to light sleep.
* We relax further: our body temperature drops, our breathing becomes regular, and we enter deep sleep. This is when your body recovers from the day.
* We dream during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.

Sleep affects every part of your body in the most incredible ways. Your brain even gets cleaned while you sleep! Here are some of the other things that a good night's sleep helps with.

* Calms your emotions
* Helps you remember new skills
* Shapes the events of the day into memories
* Fights infections
* Keeps your heart healthy
* Heals your skin
* Helps your nails grow
* Helps bones and muscles grow strong

Lots of other funny things can happen while you sleep...

Woah! Have you ever had a strang feeling that you're faling out of bed? This sometimes happens as you're falling asleep, and you jerk awake. It's called a hypnic jerk. Scientists think it happens because, as our muscles relax, our brain gets confused and thinks we're falling, so it tries to catch itself.

Snore! Nearly all children snore some of the time, especially when they have a cold, and one in ten children snores every night. It happens when something blocks the air going to your throat. It might be your tongue or your airways, which relax as you sleep, the vibrate like a musical instrument.

Chit! Children tend to talk in their sleep much more than adults. Sometimes sleep talkers make perfect sense. You can even have a conversation with them! Buf if a sleep talker is in a very deep sleep they usually talk gibberish.

Chat! Around 15 percent of children sleepwalk, and it happens more if you're not getting enough sleep. Sometimes children just sit up in bed. Sometimes they walk all around the house.

## What Are Dreams?

Dreams are mysterious things. They are pictures and stories created by our minds while we're sleeping. Sometimes they're fascinating, sometimes scary and sometimes just plain weird!

You have as many as seven dreams each night. Scientists think that even babies growing in their mothers' wombs might dream. We forget nearly all of our dreams. The funny thing is, we are most likely to remember one if we wake up in the middle of it.

It's difficult to study dreams, so there's still a lot we don't understand. Scientists are trying to discover exactly what dreams are for.

We dream during a type of sleep called REM, or Rapid Eye Movement sleep. This is what happens:

* Your eyes move quickly under your closed eyelids.
* Your legs and arms can't move, and it's a good thing they can't. You wouldn't want to act out your dreams!
* Your heart beats faster.

When you first go to bed your dreams might last just a few minutes, but towards the end of the night you can dream for up to half an hour. The place where the most fascinating stuff happens, however, is in your brain.

It might look like a bunch of pink sausages, but this is your brain! All parts of your brain are active while you dream, but one area is especially busy. It's called the limbic system, and it controls your emotions, such as anger, sadness and happiness. This might be why we often dream about the times when we've had strong feelings.

The frontal lobe is the sensible bit of the brain. This part is quieter while we dream, which could explain why our dreams can be so scary.

So the brain is very busy when we dream - but it's busy in a different way from when we're awake. Scientists think that during sleep, the brain is connecting the things we've learnt that day with everything else we've ever known. This could be why we can suddenly solve a difficult problem when we wake up!

Yesterday by the Beatles is one of the most successful songs ever written. And it started as a dream! Paul McCartney dreamt the melody, woke up and rushed to his piano before he forgot it. Think what you might do with your dreams.

* official /əˈfɪʃ.əl/
* snore /snɔːr/
* grunt /ɡrʌnt/
* sweden /ˈswiː.dən/
* decibel /ˈdes.ɪ.bel/
* loud /laʊd/
* lawn /lɑːn/
* mower /ˈmoʊ.ɚ/

The official world record for the loudest snore is held by Kare Walkert, who grunted and snored his way into the Guinness World Records in Sweden in 1993. His snore was recorded as 93 decibels, which is as loud as a lawn mower!

* britain /ˈbrɪt.ən/
* beaten /ˈbiː.t̬ən/
* whop /wɑːp/
* whopping /ˈwɑː.pɪŋ/
* noise /nɔɪz/
* noisy /ˈnɔɪ.zi/
* jet /dʒet/
* grandmother /ˈɡræn.mʌð.ɚ/
* admit /ədˈmɪt/
* champion /ˈtʃæm.pi.ən/

But a woman in Britain has beaten that record. She was recorded snoring at whopping 111.6 decibels - that's noisier than a low-flying jet! The snore came from mouth of Jenny Chapman, a grandmother who admits she's been a champion snorer for as long as she can remember.

* husband /ˈhʌz.bənd/
* describe /dɪˈskraɪb/
* roar /rɔːr/
* trumpet /ˈtrʌm.pət/
* elephant /ˈel.ə.fənt/
* orang-utan /ɔːˈræŋ.ə.tæn/
* perhaps /pɚˈhæps/

Her husband says that sleeping in the same room with Jenny is like sleeping in a zoo. This is how he describes her different snores: "There's one that's like the roar of a lion, one that's like the trumpet of an elephant, and sometimes she does that thing that orang-utans do." Perhaps it's time someone invented the world's most powerful ear plugs?

* measure /ˈmeʒ.ɚ/
* rust /rʌst/
* rustling /ˈrʌs.lɪŋ/
* chainsaw /ˈtʃeɪn.sɔː/

A decibel is the way we measure noise. The lower the decibel number, the quieter the noise. So 10 decibels is as quite as a rustling leaf, and 110 decibels is as loud as an ear-splitting chainsaw.

## Voluntary Work

* country /ˈkʌn.tri/
* govern /ˈɡʌv.ɚn/
* governance /ˈɡʌv.ɚ.nəns/
* government /ˈɡʌv.ɚn.mənt/

* vaccination /ˌvæk.səˈneɪ.ʃən/
* serious /ˈsɪr.i.əs/
* disease /dɪˈziːz/
* _all around the world_
* _many weeks or months_

In many countries, the government helps to care for people. Governments give money to workers like doctors and nurses. Sometimes, when there isn't enough money, more help is needed. More help is needed after an emergency, too. Volunteers give this help. Anyone can do voluntary work. Volunteers can be young or old. Many volunteers work with charities that help people all around the world. Some doctors and nurses fly thousands of kilometers to do voluntary work in another country. They work in hospitals or clinics for many weeks or months. They sometimes give vaccinations so that people do not get serious diseases. Every year in the USA, about sixty-two million people do voluntary work. About 8 million volunteers are 16 to 24 years old.

* negative /ˈneɡ.ə.t̬ɪv/

People who teach others do one of the most important jobs. Education helps people to get a better job and to have a better life. Education is important for everyone. When we are very young, we don't know much about anything. Our parents and other people in our family teach us many things at home. Before we go to school, they help us to eat, walk, talk, and play. They help us as much as possible at start of our life.

## At School

* Special /ˈspeʃ.əl/
* adult /ˈæd.ʌlt/
* read /riːd/
* write /raɪt/
* art /ɑːrt/
* simple /ˈsɪm.pəl/
* mathematics /ˌmæθˈmæt̬.ɪks/
* subject /ˈsʌb.dʒekt/
* geography /dʒiˈɑː.ɡrə.fi/
* zoology /zoʊˈɑː.lə.dʒi/

* drama /ˈdræm.ə/
* physics /ˈfɪz.ɪks/
* example /ɪɡˈzæm.pəl/
* exist /ɪɡˈzɪst/
* exit /ˈek.sɪt/

School teachers have a very special, important job. They get children ready for adult life. School teachers help very young children to read and write, and to do art and simple mathematics. They also teach older children subjects like geography, history, science, and languages. Many other people help in schools. Classroom assistants give more help to children who need it, for example, children who are disabled. In some schools, cooks make snacks and lunch for children and their teachers. Playground assistants help children to stay safe when they are in the playground. Sadly, many people in the world can't have a good education. Today, only about 82% of people who are more than fifteen years old can read and write.

## At College and University

* colleague /ˈkɑː.liːɡ/
* college /ˈkɑː.lɪdʒ/
* university /ˌjuː.nəˈvɝː.sə.t̬i/
* popular /ˈpɑː.pjə.lɚ/

Education isn't just for children. After school, many young people go to college or university. Some people go to college or university when they are older adults. Others study different subjects at home after work. Professors teach college and university students many different subjects, from architecture to zoology. One of the most popular university subjects is law. Professors need to know a lot about their subject so that they can help students to do well and get better jobs through life. One of the biggest universities is Indira Gandhi National Open University in India. It has about two million students.

## Volunteer Teachers

* is /ɪz/
* wonderful /ˈwʌn.dɚ.fəl/

All around the world, there are volunteer teachers. Doing voluntary work is a wonderful way to see new places and met new people. Volunteers also help many children and adults to learn information that can help them through their life. Volunteer teachers work in different ways. Some volunteers move to another country to teach there for few months or years. Others stay in their own country. Maybe they go to school for just one or two hours a week to help young children with subjects like reading and mathematics. Maybe they teach their country's language, for example, French, Spanish, or English to people who move there from another country.

Education doesn't stop after college or university. Trainers teach workers new information, for example, information technology, or a new language to help them to do their jobs better. Education really is for life.

## Growing Food

Some people are lucky because they have many different types of food to eat. In other places, people can't always grow or buy all the food that they need. Many people work to try to provide food for everyone.

Healthy food helps people to stay well because it has lots of important nutrients. When people grow food, they help themselves and other people, too. Some people have a garden or other land where they can grow fruit and vegetables for family and friends. Maybe they can't provide all the food that they all need, but they can help.

Farmers grow most of the food that people eat. In Asia, farmers grow a lot of rice, and in Europe, they grow a lot of wheat. In North America, farmers grow a lot of corn. Farmers also grow vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and onions, and fruits like apples, oranges and bananas. Some farmers raise animals so that people can eat meat like chicken and beef.

## Not Enough Food

* enough /əˈnʌf/
* cause /kɑːz/
* because /bɪˈkɑːz/
* war /wɔːr/
* nature  /ˈneɪ.tʃɚ/
* natural /ˈnætʃ.ɚ.əl/
* themselves /ðəmˈselvz/

People in some parts of the world have as much food as they need to be healthy. People in other parts of the world don't have enough to eat, and sometimes they are so hungry that they can die. In some places, people can't grow crops because the weather is too hot and dry, or too wet. This often means that they don't have enough to eat. Sometimes, people can't buy food because of a war or a natural disaster like a bad storm. Maybe food is too expensive and people don't have enough money to feed themselves and their families. Around the world, more than one billion people don't have enough food. Without food and water, people can die after only four weeks.

## Helping Hungry People

* sit /sɪt/
* seat /siːt/
* seed /siːd/
* shit /ʃɪt/
* experience /ɪkˈspɪr.i.əns/
* experienced /ɪkˈspɪr.i.ənst/
* farmer /ˈfɑːr.mɚ/
* water /ˈwɑː.t̬ɚ/
* _sit on a seat to shit_

Many people work to help others who don't have enough food. Some charities give people seeds, so that they can grow food. Experienced farmers teach other farmers how to grow the strongest, healthiest crops, like corn or sugar cane. Some charities help farmers to become fair-trade farmers. Fair-trade farmers usually sell their crops straight to stores and supermarkets, so that the farmers get more money. This helps them to buy more seeds and to grow more food. Now scientists are even making seeds that can grow with little water. In some countries, scientists have learned to make rain. They put special chemicals into very cold clouds.

## Water for Everyone

* planet /ˈplæn.ɪt/
* earth /ɝːθ/
* almost /ˈɑːl.moʊst/
* plan /plæn/
* plant /plænt/
* animal /ˈæn.ɪ.məl/
* difficult /ˈdɪf.ə.kəlt/
* enjoy /ɪnˈdʒɔɪ/
* industry /ˈɪn.də.stri/

Our planet Earth and almost everything on it needs water. Without water, plants, animals and people would die. In some places, there is a lot of water. In other places, there isn't enough water, and this makes life very difficult.

A lot of water is used for farming. Crops need water to grow, and animals drink water. In industry, people use water to help machines to work and so that they can make the things that we need and enjoy. Water is also important at home. We drink water. We use water to wash ourselves, clothes, and dishes, and to clean the home. We also use water when we flush the toilet.

## Working with Water

* river /ˈrɪv.ɚ/
* lake /leɪk/
* take /teɪk/
* reservoir /ˈrez.ɚ.vwɑːr/
* salt /sɑːlt/

Many people work to provide water for farming and industry, and for the home. Most of the fresh water that people use comes from rivers, lakes, or under the ground. People build reservoirs to store this water. They also build pipes to take it to different places. In places, where there isn't enough water, volunteers sometimes work with local people to build wells to provide water for families. They also help to keep water in wells and springs as clean as possible. Most of Earth's water is salt water in the oceans or frozen into ice. Only about 1% can be used by people for drinking, cooking, washing, farming, and industry.

## Clean Water

* touch /tʌtʃ/
* dirty /ˈdɝː.t̬i/

If people drink or touch dirty water, the can get very sick. People need clean water to stay healthy. People in richer countries are lucky because they have all the clean water that they need. In the water industry, people use chemicals to clean dirty water that people have used. In many poor countries, people have no clean water. Everyday, they have to use dirty water for cooking, drinking, and washing. More than one billion people don't have clean water to drink. In some countries, charities give people Life-Straws. Life-Straws make dirty water clean and safe to drink.

## Saving Water

* travel /ˈtræv.əl/
* collect /kəˈlekt/
* refrigerator /rɪˈfrɪdʒ.ə.reɪ.t̬ɚ/
* bath /bæθ/
* bathtub /ˈbæθ.tʌb/

Today, there are about six billion people on our planet. Every day, there are more. Many people don't have enough water, or they have to travel a long way to collect water. We need to do things now to make sure that people in the future will have enough water. We can all help to save water. Don't use too much water when you wash your hands and face, brush your teeth, and wash the dishes. Turn off the water when you have enough. Put water in the refrigerator, so that you don't have to turn on the water and use lots of it every time you want a cold drink. Take a shower not a bath. If you have to take a bath, don't fill the bathtub.

## Taxis-I

* hate /heɪt/
* taxi /ˈtæk.si/
* dangerous /ˈdeɪn.dʒɚ.əs/
* pretty /ˈprɪt̬.i/
* comfort /ˈkʌm.fɚt/
* comfortable /ˈkʌm.fɚ.t̬ə.bəl/
* uncomfortable /ʌnˈkʌm.fɚ.t̬ə/

I hate using taxis here. The drivers drive too fast and really dangerously, and they're often rude. The cars are mostly in pretty poor condition, but what I hate the most is that they aren't air-conditioned. It's so hot here. They really need air-conditioned taxis. By the time I arrive somewhere, I feel really hot and uncomfortable.

## Taxis-II

I find the taxis here are okay. They're pretty comfortable. Most of the cars they use are new, and they keep them pretty clean. They're a little expensive, though. I paid 75 dollars to come from the airport. That's too expensive. I guess the thing I hate the most, though, is that the drivers don't speak English very well. It's very difficult to explain to them where you want to go.

## Taxis-III

The taxis here are okay, I guess. The drivers take credit cards. That's the thing I like most about them. It's really convenient; but the taxis are pretty old, so they're not very comfortable. Haft of them don't have seat belts or air conditioning.

## Oprah Winfery

Oprah Winfery is a famous American TV talk show host. Forty nine million people in 134 countries watch her show every week. She lives in California but she also has a apartment in Chicago, where she works. Oprah is one of richest women in America. She earns milions of dollars every year. She gives a lot of money to charity.

She was born on January 29th, 1954 in Kosciusko, Missisippi. Her parents were very poor. Her farther, Vernon Winfrey, worked in a coal mine and her mother, Vernita, cleaned houses. They couldn't look after Oprah, so she lived with her grandmother, Hattie Mae. Oprah was clever. She could read before she was three, and when she was seventeen she received a scholarship to Tennessee State University where she studied drama. She also started reading the news at the local radion station.
