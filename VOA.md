When I was 27 years old, I worked in an office in San Francisco. I did my job well and my future was promising. I was alone in the world and I was happy.

On Saturday afternoons, I didn't work. I sailed my little sailboat on San Francisco Bay.

One Saturday afternoon, I sailed out too far. The strong afternoon wind pushed my sailboat out of the bay, and into the Pacific Ocean.

That night, when I had lost all hope, a small British brig saw me and took me on board. The brig was sailing to London.

The voyage was long and stormy. I worked as a sailor to pay for my trip.

When I arrived in London, my clothes were old and dirty. I had only one dollar in my pocket. With this dollar, I ate and slept for the first twenty four hours.

During the next twenty four hours, I didn't eat and I didn't sleep. At about ten o'clock the following morning, I went to Portland Place.

I saw a child walking past holding a big pear. The child ate one small piece and then threw the pear onto the street.

I stopped and looked at it.
