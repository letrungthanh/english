## ILA comments

### 1st

Xu had a mostly great speaking test. She provided charming responses to the introductory questions, including telling me that she was _wonderful_ which is lovely to hear.

A lot of her responses were short, but accurate. So for example, when asked _are you tall?_ she replied simply _no_. Similarly, when asked about the characters in the textbooks she gave short succinct responses about their various moods, saying _no_, _no_, _yes_. For even better responses in test conditions, it would be amazing to see her incorporate the full pronoun structure _no he isn't_ / _yes she is_.

She gave nice full responses to the _how many_ questions, making sentences such as _there are two apples_ and _there are 6 eggs_. Which garnered perfect marks for this section.

Similarly, her responses during the vegetable vocabulary section were great! She responded _these are beans_, _they are carrot_, and _they are pepper_. I will say that Xu should be careful in the future to make sure she is applying the pluralising _s_ to the end of these nouns. On this occasion, I don't think it was applied to the end of carrot or pepper.

Otherwise, she gave nice and good responses to my more miscellaneous questions about the picture on page 74 of the textbook.

### 2nd

#### Grammar and Vocabulary 30/30

Xu has scored a perfect 30! Which is not surprising because she is always meticulous and pays great attention to detail while writing. Her handwriting is crystal clear and she is very good at grammar and spellings. She is wonderfully articulate for her age and has tremendous potential to do well in languages and communication. I am counting on this little girl to do great things in school and also in life.

#### Speaking 60/60

Xu answered all the questions with perfection. Her answers ware correctly structured, and she used all the grammar and vocabulary learnt in class. Her concepts are clear. Her pronunciation is immaculate. Overall, a brilliant student. She is articulate beyond her years and is clearly gifted in languages and communication.

#### Listening 8/10

Pretty good listening skills! Pay closer attention to the teacher.

## A Trip to the Stars

The night sky is filled with stars. From here on Earth, they all look similar - tiny, white, twinkly. But imagine flying into space to see the stars up close. Out there, it's obvious how different stars are! The first star we'd arrive at is the Sun. Yes, the Sun is a star, and a pretty.
